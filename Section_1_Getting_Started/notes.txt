=> What is TypeScript?

-> TypeScript is a JavaScript superset, meaning it's language that buulds upon JavaScript and adds new features and advantages to JavaScript.

-> Runtimes that support running JavaScript, like the browser or a NodeJs server, don't support TypeScript directly.
    - TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript code

-> TypeScript adds types to JavaScript
    - This allows us to catch some errors as early as in the development phase
    - One example would be having a function that is supposed to sum two numbers and we pass in numbers disguised as characters.
